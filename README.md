Here are my config files that use in my workflow.

I use Kubuntu and i3.

karabiner.sh is usually located in ~/Documents and contains commands that remap right alt to use as separate modifier and caps lock is remapped to backspace.

config is the i3 config file that has to be located in ~/.config/i3 and contains my keyboard mappings for system-wide use.
